The file Part1, Part2 and Part3 is the code for the Part-1, Part-2, Part-3 in the assignment..

* Part1 is the normal analysis
* Part2 is the analysis after stemming the words using normolization of words. This is a inbuilt function in the Matlab
* Part3 is the analysis after grouping all related words to same token and making the clusters
* The Part-4 is divided into three files as Part41, Part42, Part43
  1. The Part4 clustering is entirely different and we used kernel spectral clustering approach for all the three codes.
  2. In the Part4 the code files have a variable num_clusters which can be changed to get the clusters as 2,3,4 accordingly as required in the assignemnt.


* The path to the dataset is to be changed accordingly for each code file. By defauly I have used the matlab Drive path which I have used to derive the results.
* The "Outputs" File contains the outputs for the code files against the given datasets.
* The "ResultsAndAnalysis" file contains the analysis and comparision of the results of the outputs.
